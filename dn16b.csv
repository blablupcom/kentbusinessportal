Entry to the process is voluntary, with approximately 55% of the local cohort opting to take part, plus a significant number of external candidates. Tests are taken in early September of the year prior to the year of admission to grammar school. There is a second stage – Head Teacher Referral – where additional evidence can be considered alongside scores before assessments are confirmed. Results are made available to parents in the third week of October following the tests. In order to meet this commitment, the LA requires standardised test scores to be available within 8 working days of the last test date. The current requirement is approximately 14,500 sets of tests per annum, though this could rise or fall in the course of the contract. 
KCC is looking for a supplier to provide tests to support the admission process. The contractor will be required to: compile, trial, produce or print as appropriate and deliver to the Council a set of tests to support the admission process.
This contract is anticipated to commence as soon as the tender is awarded for the delivery of the testing process in September 2016. Extensions are available for the 2017 and 2018 test.
